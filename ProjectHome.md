CryptoFBC is the simple form of Cryptography Library For Black Chamber.

I write this cryptography library only for my interests.

Coding Language: C++ (pure OOP)

Currently,some cryptographic algorithms have been implemented,they are:

Hash:

CRC16

CRC32,

MD4,

MD5,

SHA1(SHA 160)

SHA256

Symmetric Cipher:

Blowfish,

DES,

IDEA,

Tea,

Twofish,

AES(Rijndael),

SMS4,

RC5

Stream Ciphers:

RC4


Misc:

Base32

Base64

more will come.

ECDLP(Elliptic Curve Discret Logrithm Problem) Solver v0.6

Changes:

v0.1 implemented the pollard's pho original algorithm 4.3

v0.2 changed Branches L to 32

v0.3 some codes optimized

v0.4 changed Floyd's cycleing finding algorithm to Brent's improved cycle algorithm,more faster

v0.5 implemented Pohlig-Hellman algorithm,much more faster

v0.6 fixed the pollard's pho method failded bug
